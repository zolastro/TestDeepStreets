    What is this?
  </h1>
  <p>I am currently testing my master's final project. This involves generating realistic outputs from a map-sketch. Here is an example:</p>
  <div>
    <img class="example" src="assets/images/examples/59.jpg">
    <figcaption>Input - Fake Output - Target Output</figcaption>
  </div>
    
  <p>To test these results, I need your help. I am going to show you two different satelite images. One is real and the other isn't. Try to select the one that you think is real. 
    It is not a competition, so don't worry if you are not able to distingish them (thats the whole point of the project). Are you ready?</p>
  <button (click)="readyClicked()" class="ready-button" mat-raised-button color="accent">I'm ready!</button>
</div>  

<div class="info" *ngIf="ready">
  <h2>
    Select the real one:
  </h2>
  <mat-slide-toggle
  class="example-margin"
  color="accent"
  [(ngModel)]="showCountdown">
  Show countdown
  </mat-slide-toggle>
  <app-question [showCountdown]=showCountdown (onSelect)="answerSelected($event)" [question]="question"></app-question>
  <button (click)="getNewQuestion()" class="ready-button" mat-raised-button color="accent">I wasn't looking! ðŸ¤ž</button>
  <p>Feel free to stop whenever you want. Thanks for helping!</p>
