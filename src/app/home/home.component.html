    What is this?
</h1>
<p>I am currently testing my master's final project. This involves generating realistic outputs from a map-sketch. Here is an example:</p>
<div>
    <img class="example" src="assets/images/examples/59.jpg">
    <figcaption>Input - Fake Output - Target Output</figcaption>
</div>
<p>To test these results, I need your help. I am going to show you two different satellite images. Try to select the one that you think is real. Some times both of them are! Check them quickly though since you only can check them for one second. It is not a competition, so don't worry if you are not able to distinguish them (that's the whole point of the project). 
    Are you ready?</p>
